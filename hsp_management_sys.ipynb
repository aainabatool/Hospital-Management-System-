The goal of the project is to demonstrate the application of various programming concepts such as classes, functions, loops, conditionals, dictionaries, lists, strings, and Numpy. The system is designed to manage basic operations in a hospital, including patient management, doctor management, and appointment scheduling. Additionally, the data is saved in CSV format and analyzed using the Numpy library for aggregate operations, such as calculating the average number of appointments per doctor."
